# HTML, CSS & Javascript Project

In the following repository I am going to create projects by using vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript in order to improve my skills.



### 1. Calculator

Created a basic Calculator to perform operations like:
- Addition 
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

### 2. Clock

Created a simple clock where hour, minutes and seconds hand rotate based on actual time from the date() function.
